**NOTE**: I'm currently in the process of converting this application from Ruby on Rails to Javascript with [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), so I have had to stop further development and take the Beta version offline for the time being.

The main purpose of this tool is to give local community organizers of Super Smash Bros. Melee a history of tournaments and matches between their players. It becomes very difficult to keep track of progress of players over very long running weekly or biweekly tournament series, some of these tournaments run consistently for years. It uses a public API from [Challonge](http://challonge.com), a widely used bracket building app, to pull and parse player and match data.

After the uploader sanitizes player information to their liking and commits the data it can be viewed in a simple, easy to use interface. The application keeps track of wins and losses against other players, across what tournaments, and can be used to track player progress over a longer period of time than is originally feasible without it.

The application uses individual user accounts to keep uploads separate from one user to another, this way any player or community organizer can upload tournaments, either to see how the players in their region stack up against each other or how one player performs over a series of tournaments.

I hope to be able to continue development of this project and soon be able to release it to the smash community as a whole.
