<h2 class="green-underline">Create New Community</h2>
<p>
	Creating a new community is easy! Just give it a name and a description and you'll be added as an admin. Names and descriptions can be changed later on so don't worry about deciding on one now. Once created you can add other users as members or admins as well as start upload tournaments.
